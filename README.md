Folks, I am not working on this game for the foreseeable future 
The Original Sonic.EXE Game
Sonic.EXE Version 7 is finally here! This update brings a variety of graphical improvements, audio improvements, no less a few 'not-so-little' updates to the game world.  To top it off, there are a number of performance optimisations made to the game's engine to help the gameplay experience feel that little bit smoother.
Some old secrets still lurk, but may appear different in form - and some? May have even been replaced by new, sinister worlds where the influence of 'X' has spread. Explore, and don't think for a second that the path you've taken will remain the same - turn back, keep your eyes peeled for changes. You may be rewarded for your efforts. Well... "reward" might not be the word for it.~
The game took about 3 days to whip up, and is not a full representation of my programming ability - it was simply something I made for a laugh. I never expected it to come this far since the original release. Bear that in mind.
Some Antivirus software may report this program - rest assured, this is a false positive

IF I've forgotten someone here, directly message me about it and I'll add them. Nothing is 'sToLeN' - the game is entirely non-profit and I've done my best to credit all assets used, but like I said - if someone should be here, and isn't, directly message me and I'll correct it. This game is 10 years old, people don't particularly care anymore, so don't be a salty asshat in the comments. Shrouded, at the very least, is an original IP with assets developed specficially for that game and/or created by myself. Happy?
